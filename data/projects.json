Each week we would collaboratively develop a lesson plan which we would work on with the participants. The participants varied in age from 18  65 years of age and had visual, audio, linguistic and physical disabilities or impairments. Many of them had never used a computer before. Our projects were heavily based around using the Adobe suite such as; PhotoShop, Illustrator and Animate. We were successfully able to create engaging workshops which helped build the confidence of our participants as well as their knowledge of computers and what can be created using them. Our team was able to provide a space of positive support which led to the development of many strong relationships with the participants.",
